# Electoral Visualization

Team 8's repository encompasses the frontend development utilizing D3 and the Vue.js framework, complemented by Tailwind CSS for streamlined styling and layout. Our goal is to incorporate three distinct visualization types: time-series, state-by-state, and third-party comparison visualizations. The data will be dynamically fetched from the backend Python code hosted on AWS Lambda. Leveraging AWS Athena for precise data querying and AWS API Gateway for content retrieval, our solution ensures responsive and accurate data visualization. This collaborative effort combines cutting-edge frontend technologies with robust backend infrastructure to deliver comprehensive and interactive data visualization experiences.
